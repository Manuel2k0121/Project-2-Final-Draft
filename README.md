# Project-2

I will be using multiple seqeunce alignment to compare the BRCA1 gene of three different animal species. I will show these results using sequence logo. Then I will find the level expression of this gene in all three species after this gene has been mutated. I will do this using RNA Seq and show the results through a heatmap. I included the rmd and pdf of my project 2 rough draft in this repository. I will be updating them as I finish more of my project. My scientific question is as follows: BRCA1 gene is a tumor suppresor gene found in many species including humans, dogs, and cats. When there is a mutation in this gene, cancer is more prone to develop? My hypothesis is: If there was a mutation in the BRCA1 gene of these three different species, then all of them will have decreased levels of expression of this gene due to it being a tumor suppressorgene. Although the levels of expression will decrease for all three, they will vary in how much the expression decreases after mutated.
